Questions from http://www.toptal.com/sql/interview-questions

- What does `UNION` do? What is the difference between `UNION` and `UNION ALL`?
- List and explain the different types of `JOIN` clauses supported in ANSI-standard SQL.
- Consider the following two query results:
```
SELECT count(*) AS total FROM orders;

+-------+
| total |
+-------+
|  100  |
+-------+

SELECT count(*) AS cust_123_total FROM orders WHERE customer_id = '123';

+----------------+
| cust_123_total |
+----------------+
|       15       |
+----------------+
```
Given the above query results, what will be the result of the query below?
```
SELECT count(*) AS cust_not_123_total FROM orders WHERE customer_id <> '123'
```

-  What will be the result of the query below? Explain your answer and provide a version that behaves correctly.
```
select case when null = null then 'Yup' else 'Nope' end as Result;
```

- Given the following tables:
```
sql> SELECT * FROM runners;
+----+--------------+
| id | name         |
+----+--------------+
|  1 | John Doe     |
|  2 | Jane Doe     |
|  3 | Alice Jones  |
|  4 | Bobby Louis  |
|  5 | Lisa Romero  |
+----+--------------+

sql> SELECT * FROM races;
+----+----------------+-----------+
| id | event          | winner_id |
+----+----------------+-----------+
|  1 | 100 meter dash |  2        |
|  2 | 500 meter dash |  3        |
|  3 | cross-country  |  2        |
|  4 | triathalon     |  NULL     |
+----+----------------+-----------+
```
What will be the result of the query below?
```
SELECT * FROM runners WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT winner_id FROM races)
```
Explain your answer and also provide an alternative version of this query that will avoid the issue that it exposes.

- Given two tables created and populated as follows:
```
CREATE TABLE dbo.envelope(id int, user_id int);
CREATE TABLE dbo.docs(idnum int, pageseq int, doctext varchar(100));

INSERT INTO dbo.envelope VALUES
  (1,1),
  (2,2),
  (3,3);

INSERT INTO dbo.docs(idnum,pageseq) VALUES
  (1,5),
  (2,6),
  (null,0);
```
What will the result be from the following query:
```
UPDATE docs SET doctext=pageseq FROM docs INNER JOIN envelope ON envelope.id=docs.idnum
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM dbo.docs
  WHERE id=envelope.id
);
```

- What is wrong with this SQL query? Correct it so it executes properly.
```
SELECT Id, YEAR(BillingDate) AS BillingYear 
FROM Invoices
WHERE BillingYear >= 2010;
```

- Given these contents of the Customers table:
```
Id	Name			ReferredBy
1	John Doe		NULL
2	Jane Smith		NULL
3	Anne Jenkins		2
4	Eric Branford		NULL
5	Pat Richards		1
6	Alice Barnes		2
```
Here is a query written to return the list of customers not referred by Jane Smith:
```
SELECT Name FROM Customers WHERE ReferredBy <> 2;
```
What will be the result of the query? Why? What would be a better way to write it?

- Considering the database schema displayed in the SQLServer-style diagram below, write a SQL query to return a list of all the invoices. For each invoice, show the Invoice ID, the billing date, the customerâ€™s name, and the name of the customer who referred that customer (if any). The list should be ordered by billing date.

- Assume a schema of `Emp ( Id, Name, DeptId ) , Dept ( Id, Name).`

If there are 10 records in the Emp table and 5 records in the Dept table, how many rows will be displayed in the result of the following SQL query: `Select * From Emp, Dept`

- Given a table SALARIES, such as the one below, that has `m = male` and `f = female` values. Swap all `f` and `m` values (i.e., change all `f` values to `m` and vice versa) with a single update query and no intermediate temp table.
```
Id  Name  Sex  Salary
1   A     m    2500
2   B     f    1500
3   C     m    5500
4   D     f    500
```

- Given two tables created as follows
```
create table test_a(id numeric);

create table test_b(id numeric);

insert into test_a(id) values
  (10),
  (20),
  (30),
  (40),
  (50);

insert into test_b(id) values
  (10),
  (30),
  (50);
```
Write a query to fetch values in table `test_a` that are and not in `test_b` **without** using the NOT keyword.

- Given a table `TBL` with a field `Nmbr` that has rows with the following values:
```
1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1
```
Write a query to add 2 where `Nmbr` is 0 and add 3 where `Nmbr` is 1.

- Write a SQL query to find the 10th highest employee salary from an `Employee` table. Explain your answer. (Note: You may assume that there are at least 10 records in the `Employee` table.)
- Write a SQL query using `UNION ALL` (not `UNION`) that uses the `WHERE` clause to eliminate duplicates. Why might you want to do this?
- Given the following tables:
```
SELECT * FROM users;

user_id  username
1        John Doe                                                                                            
2        Jane Don                                                                                            
3        Alice Jones
